			<p><img class="content-img" src="images/MobyDick.jpg" width="150" height="200">"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,—"Up helm! Keep her off round the world!"</p>
			
			<p><img class="content-img" src="images/AliceinWonderland.jpg" width="150" height="200">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
			
			<p><img class="content-img" src="images/PeterRabbit.jpg" width="150" height="200">“There is something delicious about writing the first words of a story. You never quite know where they'll take you.” ― Beatrix Potter</p>
			
			<p><img class="content-img" src="images/commonsense-guide-to-cooking.jpg" width="150" height="200">Publisher: Family Circle/Murdoch Books <br>Date Published: 1998<br>Pages: 384
			<br>Cooking – A Commonsense Guide was given to me when I was 15 (2003) and initially I took this little gem for granted. It did not have the flamboyant covers nor chique photography of most modern cookbooks. But it was later on that I realised its true value.</p>
			
			<p><img class="content-img" src="images/DC.jpg" width="150" height="200">When a young man stumbles upon a cosmic anomaly, the DC and Marvel Universes begin to merge with some most unexpected results. The Juggernaut is running amuck in Metropolis, the murderous Bullseye invades the Batcave, Robin the Boy Wonder pops up at Xavier's School for the Gifted, and J. Jonah Jameson is Editor-n-Chief of the Daily Planet. Then, things get worse when the very fabric of reality threatens to destroy itself. Now, the champions of two universes must combat each other for the fate of their own existence. Includes the back-up feature "Decision '96" with dossiers on Superman, Hulk, Captain America, Batman, Wonder Woman, Storm, Wolverine, Lobo, Superboy, and Spider-Man. Plus, the ballet for the readers to vote and decide the pivotal battles and thus the outcome of this epic event. Cover price $3.95.</p>
